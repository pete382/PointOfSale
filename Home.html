   <h3> Mother Earth </h3>
<p> 
    He looked up into the night sky and saw the endless counts of stars, each possibly bearing a livable moon or planet.  The real distances between them much too difficult to ever imagine.  Alone and in the silent splendor, the immensity of time also weighed in on his meditation.  The next star he remembered was still seventy eight thousand years away. This reality corralled some of his wonder for a few seconds. And even if the long voyage were ever to succeed no human could ever be sure of a perfectly hospitable new home.  He surmised with some cosmic irony that was sad, funny and true: we have only one home.</p>

<h3>Energy Sobriety</h3>
  
<p> It was about 6 o'clock early evening in the middle of downtown Chicago when the sky opened up and let out a torrential down pour.  Sixty degrees in February wasn't the kind of weather we're use to around here. Apparently, our climate felt the same.  And standing in the darkness surrounded by this winter rain I had a feeling more apocalyptic than wet. 
    Even the droplets had more grith to them, It reminded me of Miami during my university years. But Florida remains the rainfall king as far as I can remember. And yet, waking up in total darkeness to catch a bus in the middle of a Miami downpour had the same beginning of the end sensation all those years ago. </p>
<p> So will our future be brought to rebear countless weather phenomena out of place with our old notions of normalcy.  The silver lining may be that our politicians might wake up from their donor regiments to fast track energy sobriety.</P>

   <h3> Columbus Must Die !</h3>
<p> 
    Are we good stewards for the Earth ?
    Where fortunes seethe no lilacs grow.
    Nature is selfish but humans are greedy.
    Greed follows greed, crowding out his neighbors with guns and bombs.
    The ape predator drowns by its own singular intelligence.
    Our skies once held summer and our waters teamed with life,
    now they lay prostrate to cars, highways, mass extinctions,
    fire seasons, wild storms.    
    Today we speak of nuclear weapons like casual dinner chatter.
    They call this progress:  the dying planet.
    All this pollution, all this hatred of other peoples and  Mother Earth, is why Columbus must DIE !
    </p>
